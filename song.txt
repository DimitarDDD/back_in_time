Back In Time
Huey Lewis

Tell me, doctor, where are we going this time
Is this the 50's, or 1999
All I wanted to do, was play my guitar and sing

So take me away, I don't mind
But you better promise me, I'll be back in time

Gotta get back in time 
when i was a child and we were together 
but now i dont give fuck 
Just gimme the light and pass the dro 
Buss anotha bottle a moe
Gal dem inna mi sight and I got to know
(Yo, yo, yo yo yo)

I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
